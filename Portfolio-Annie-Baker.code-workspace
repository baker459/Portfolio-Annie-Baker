      <h2>Annie Baker
        <h3>UX/UI Designer
    <section id="about">
      <p>I’m a creative and driven individual who has always had a keen interest in design. 
I started my career in the hospitality industry where I honed my skills in customer service and problem-solving, all while constantly being inspired by the different cultures and designs I encountered in my world travels.
Despite my success in the hospitality industry, I always felt drawn towards design and decided to pursue my dream of becoming a UX/UI Designer. I enrolled in a bootcamp program offered by the University of Oregon where I was able to learn the necessary skills and techniques to turn my passion into a career. 
My dedication and natural talent for design allowed me to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that addressed the needs of different users from project to project. As I embark on this new chapter in my career as a UX/UI Designer, I remain committed to using my creativity and skills to create designs that are not only beautiful and functional, but also compassionate and inclusive. </p>

        <h3>"Water U Doing?" Hydration Competition Prototype
</h3>
        <p>People are not motivated to stay hydrated despite how crucial it is to our health. The solution is to offer health-conscious people a mobile application to track their hydration and compete in varying hydration challenges against themselves and/or friends.</p>
